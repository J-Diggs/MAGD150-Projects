# Welcome to my MAGD 150 Project Page
  -These programs are some of the tasks we were asked to create throughout the class.
  -These programs for me are to show my creativity or lack thereof for these themes in the projects, I hope you enjoy!


## Lab 06
-This Lab was trying to focus on creating a simple retro style game. I tried to make a simple gemoetry style game where the objective is to dodge the green circles for as long as you can.

## Lab 10

## Lab 09
-For this lab, we were tasked on adding a video and an image that had a filter applied to them. The theme for our assingment was to try and replicate a mirror so I tried to use the reflection of an old gameboy as the border.
